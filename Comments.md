# BCB Code Comments

I might have coded myself into a corner where you oen up a Coin on the accordion.
                            
Then On the filters, when you view and or select data period. The Data persists when you close one coin and open anotther

### Use Of Charts
I could have added Charts to make the UI more visually nice and have filter buttons for the time intervals.


### WebSockets
Truth be told, I have not had the opportunity to create, consume WebSockets.
In my research, I saw how WebSockets can be implemented when creating an API using NestJs, 

However that was not the sam case when consuming WebSocket using Nest.
